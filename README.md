Nachman Lab Portal

A structured data engineering and documentation framework for organizing laboratory protocols, project metadata, and computational workflows in the Nachman Lab.

Purpose

The Nachman Lab Portal is designed to centralize and standardize research documentation across projects. The system supports:

Reproducible research practices

Structured metadata tracking

Protocol curation and version control

Computational workflow documentation

Undergraduate training in research data management

This repository serves as the foundation for a scalable lab-wide knowledge and data infrastructure.

Core Objectives

Establish standardized templates for lab, field, and computational protocols

Create structured metadata schemas for research projects and datasets

Improve reproducibility and cross-project consistency

Enable efficient data retrieval and documentation tracking

Build infrastructure for future web or dashboard integration

Long-Term Vision

Formal relational database schema

Automated metadata validation

Dashboard interface

Searchable internal knowledge base

Integration with sequencing and analysis pipelines
